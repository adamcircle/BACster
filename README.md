# BACster: Track your drinking and calculate your BAC

## Unfortunately, BACster was rejected by Apple because software BAC calculators are banned üòì. So, I'm open sourcing the code. Hopefully someone will find this helpful! 

Accidentally put your hand through the wall, again? Threw up just three feet from the toilet? We've been there.

BACster is a new app that helps you track your drinking habits and calculate your BAC in realtime, to help you avoid any more messy nights. Instead of forcing you to calculate drink sizes and alcohol percentages while you're drunk (who even does that?), BACster allows you to enter drinks in a simple menu, with hundreds of choices from a built-in database. Give it a try--and drink responsibly!
